<p>The main goal of today's post is to show a bit more of what is now possible with the latest Windbg (currently branded <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2017/08/28/new-windbg-available-preview/">"WinDbg Preview"</a> in the Microsoft store) and the time travel debugging tools that Microsoft released a few months ago. When these finally got released, a bit after <a href="https://cppcon2017.sched.com/">cppcon2017</a> this year, I expected a massive pick-up from the security / reverse-engineering industry with a bunch of posts, tools, scripts, etc. To my surprise, this has not happened yet so I have waited patiently for my vacation to write a little something about it myself. So, here goes!</p>
<p>Obviously, one of the most <em>noticeable</em> change in this debugger is the new UI.. but this is not something we will talk about. The <em>second</em> big improvement is .. a decent scripting engine! Until recently, I always had to use <a href="https://pykd.codeplex.com/">pyKD</a> to write automation scripts. This has worked <em>fairly</em> well for years, but I’m glad to move away from it and embrace the new extension model provided by Windbg &amp; Javascript (yes, you read this right). One of the biggest pain point I’ve to deal with with pyKD (aside from the installation process!) is that you had to evaluate many commands and then parse their outputs to extract the bits and pieces you needed. Thankfully, the new <em>debugger data model</em> solves this (or part of this anyway). The third new change is the integration of the time travel debugging (TTD) features discussed in this presentation: <a href="https://cppcon2017.sched.com/event/Bgsj/time-travel-debugging-root-causing-bugs-in-commercial-scale-software">Time Travel Debugging: Root Causing Bugs in Commercial Scale Software
</a>.</p>
<p>The goal of this post is to leverage all the nifty stuff we will learn to enumerate x64 <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/cpp/cpp/try-except-statement">try/except</a> handlers in Javascript.</p>
<p>So grab yourself a cup of fine coffee and read on :).</p>

<p>Binary instrumentation and analysis have been subjects that I have always found fascinating. At compile time via <a href="http://doar-e.github.io/blog/2016/11/27/clang-and-passes/">clang</a>, or at runtime with dynamic binary instrumentation frameworks like <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool">Pin</a> or <a href="http://www.dynamorio.org/">DynamoRIO</a>. One thing I have always looked for though, is a framework able to statically instrument a PE image. A framework designed a bit like <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">clang</a> where you can write 'passes' doing various things: transformation of the image, analysis of code blocks, etc. Until a couple of months ago, I wasn't aware of any public and robust projects providing this capability (as in, able to instrument real-world scale programs like Chrome or similar).</p>
<p>In this post (it's been a while I know!), I'll introduce the <a href="https://github.com/google/syzygy">syzygy</a> transformation tool chain with a focus on its <a href="https://github.com/google/syzygy/tree/master/syzygy/instrument">instrumenter</a>, and give an overview of the framework, its capabilities, its limitations, and how you can write transformations yourself. As examples, I'll walk through two simple examples: an analysis pass generating a call-graph, and a transformation pass rewriting the function <code>__report_gsfailure</code> in <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8dbf701c.aspx">/GS</a> protected binaries.</p>

                <div class="summary"><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>About three years ago, the LLVM framework started to pique my interest for a lot of different reasons. This collection of industrial strength compiler technology, as <a href="http://llvm.org/pubs/2008-10-04-ACAT-LLVM-Intro.pdf">Latner</a> said in 2008, was designed in a very modular way. It also looked like it had a lot of interesting features that could be used in a lot of (different) domains: code-optimization (think <a href="https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Tigress_protection">deobfuscation</a>), (architecture independent) <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/articles/blob/master/Obfuscation%20of%20steel%20meet%20Kryptonite.pdf">code obfuscation</a>, static code instrumentation (think <a href="https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki">sanitizers</a>), <a href="http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/index.html">static analysis</a>, for runtime software exploitation mitigations (think <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ControlFlowIntegrity.html">cfi</a>, <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/docs/SafeStack.html">safestack</a>), power a fuzzing framework (think <a href="http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html">libFuzzer</a>), ..you name it.</p>
<p>A lot of the power that came with this giant library was partly because it would operate in mainly three stages, and you were free to hook your code in any of those: front-end, mid-end, back-end. Other strengths included: the high number of back-ends, the documentation, the C/C++ APIs, the community, ease of use compared to gcc (see below from kcc's <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/cauldron2012?action=AttachFile&amp;do=get&amp;target=kcc.pdf">presentation</a>), etc.</p>
<p><center><img alt="GCC from a newcomer's perspective" src="/images/token_capture_via_llvm_based_static_analysis_pass/llvmvsgcc.png"></center>
The front-end part takes as input source code and generates LLVM IL code, the middle part operates on LLVM IL and finally the last one receives LLVM IL in order to output assembly code and or an executable file.</p>
<p><center><img alt="Major components in a three phase compiler" src="/images/token_capture_via_llvm_based_static_analysis_pass/llvm_architecture.png"></center>
In this post we will walk through a simple LLVM pass that does neither optimization, nor obfuscation; but acts more as a token finder for fuzzing purposes. </p>

<p>I think it all began when I've worked on the <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/tree/master/NoSuchCon2013">NSC2013</a> crackme made by <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">@elvanderb</a>, long story short you had an AES128 heavily obfuscated white-box implementation to break. The thing was you could actually solve the challenge in different ways: </p>
<ol>
<li>the first one was the easiest one: you didn't need to know anything about white-box, crypto or even AES ; you could just see the function as a black-box &amp; try to find "design flaws" in its inner-workings</li>
<li>the elite way: this one involved to understand &amp; recover the entire design of the white-box, then to identify design weaknesses that allows the challenger to directly attack &amp; recover the encryption key. A really nice write-up has been recently written by <a href="https://twitter.com/doegox">@doegox</a>, check it out, really :): <a href="http://wiki.yobi.be/wiki/NSC_Writeups">Oppida/NoSuchCon challenge</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The annoying thing is that you don't have a lot of understandable available C code on the web that implement such things, nevertheless you do have quite some nice academic references ; they are a really good resource to build your own.</p>
<p>This post aims to present briefly, in a simple way what an AES white-box looks like, and to show how its design is important if you want to not have your encryption key extracted :). The implementation I'm going to talk about today is not my creation at all, I just followed the first part (might do another post talking about the second part? Who knows) of a really <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/raw/master/wbaes_attack/docs/a_tutorial_on_whitebox_aes.pdf">nice paper</a> (even for non-mathematical / crypto guys like me!) written by James A. Muir.</p>
<p>The idea is simple: we will start from a clean AES128 encryption function in plain C, we will modify it &amp; transform it into a white-box implementation in several steps.
As usual, all the code are available on my github account; you are encourage to break &amp; hack them!</p>
<p>Of course, we will use this post to briefly present what is the white-box cryptography, what are the goals &amp; why it's kind of cool.</p>

<p>As the blog was a bit silent for quite some time, I figured it would be cool to put together a post ; so here it is folks, dig in!</p>
<p>The French company <a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/you-like-python-security-challenge-and-traveling-win-a-free-ticket-to-hitb-kul.html">Quarkslab</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/quarkslab/status/507457671386394624">recently</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/HITBSecConf/status/507458788522094592">released</a> a security challenge to win a free entrance to attend the upcoming <a href="https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2014kul/">HITBSecConf</a> conference in Kuala Lumpur from the 13th of October until the 16th.</p>
<p>The challenge has been written by <a href="http://blog.quarkslab.com/author/serge-guelton.html">Serge Guelton</a>, a R&amp;D engineer specialized in compilers/parallel computations. At the time of writing, already eight different people manage to solve the challenge, and one of the ticket seems to have been won by <code>hackedd</code>, so congrats to him!</p>
<p><center><img alt="woot.png" src="/images/dissection_of_quarkslab_s_2014_security_challenge/woot.png"></center>
According to the description of the challenge Python is heavily involved, which is a good thing for at least two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>first because I already had <a href="https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2014/04/17/deep-dive-into-pythons-vm-story-of-load_const-bug/">the occasion</a> to look at its source code in the past,</li>
<li>and because I so am a <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/tree/master/Python's%20internals">big fan of Python</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post I will describe how I tackled this problem, how I managed to solve it. And to make up for me being slow at solving it I tried to make it fairly detailed. </p>
<p>At first it was supposed to be quite short though, but well..I decided to analyze fully the challenge even if it wasn't needed to find the key unfortunately, so it is a bit longer than expected :-).</p>
<p>Anyway, sit down, make yourself at home and let me pour you a cup of tea before we begin :-).</p>

                <div class="summary"><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>A year ago, I've written a Python script to leverage a bug in Python's virtual machine: the idea was to fully control the Python virtual processor and after that to instrument the VM to execute native codes. The <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/blob/master/Python's%20internals/python27_abuse_vm_to_execute_x86_code.py">python27_abuse_vm_to_execute_x86_code.py</a> script wasn't really self-explanatory, so I believe only a few people actually took some time to understood what happened under the hood. The purpose of this post is to give you an explanation of the bug, how you can control the VM and how you can turn the bug into something that can be more useful. It's also a cool occasion to see how works the Python virtual machine from a low-level perspective: what we love so much right?</p>
<p>But before going further, I just would like to clarify a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I haven't found this bug, this is quite old and <strong>known</strong> by the Python developers (trading safety for performance), so don't panic this is <strong>not</strong> a 0day or a new bug ; can be a cool CTF trick though</li>
<li>Obviously, YES I know we can also "escape" the virtual machine with the <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html">ctypes</a> module ; but this is a feature not a bug. In addition, ctypes is always "removed"  from sandbox implementation in Python</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, keep in mind I will focus Python 2.7.5 x86 on Windows ; but obviously this is adaptable for other systems and architectures, so this is left as an exercise to the interested readers.
All right, let's move on to the first part: this one will focus the essentials about the VM, and Python objects.</p>

<p>The purpose of this little post is to create a piece of code able to monitor exceptions raised in a process (a bit like <a href="http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/">gynvael</a>'s <a href="http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=148">ExcpHook</a> but in userland), and to generate a report with information related to the exception. The other purpose is to have a look at the internals of course.</p>

<p>That's why I divided this post in two big parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first one will talk about Windows internals background required to understand how things work under the hood,</li>
<li>the last one will talk about <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/"><em>Detours</em></a> and how to hook <em>ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher</em> toward our purpose. Basically, the library gives programmers a set of APIs to easily hook procedures. It also has a clean and readable documentation, so you should use it! It is usually used for that kind of things:</li>
<li>Hot-patching bugs (no need to reboot),</li>
<li>Tracing API calls (<a href="http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor">API Monitor</a> like),</li>
<li>Monitoring (a bit like our example),</li>
<li>Pseudo-sandboxing (prevent API calls),</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Kryptonite</em> was a proof-of-concept I built to obfuscate codes at the LLVM intermediate representation level. The idea was to use semantic-preserving transformations in order to not break the original program. One of the main idea was for example to build a home-made 32 bits adder to replace the <em>add</em> LLVM instruction. Instead of having a single asm instruction generated at the end of the pipeline, you will end up with a ton of assembly codes doing only an addition. If you never read my article, and you are interested in it here it is: <a href="http://0vercl0k.tuxfamily.org/bl0g/?p=260">Obfuscation of steel: meet my Kryptonite</a>.</p>
<p><center><img alt="home-made-adder.png" src="/images/breaking_kryptonite_s_obfuscation_with_symbolic_execution/home-made-adder.png"></center></p>
<p>In this post I wanted to show you how we can manage to break that obfuscation with symbolic execution. We are going to write a really tiny symbolic execution engine with IDAPy, and we will use Z3Py to simplify all our equations. Note that a friend of mine <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">@elvanderb</a> used a similar approach (more generic though) to simplify some parts of the <a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/overclokblog/Obfuscation%20of%20steel%3a%20meet%20my%20Kryptonite/binaries/">crackme</a> ; but he didn't wanted to publish it, so here is my blog post about it!</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, I was peacefully coding some stuff you know but I couldn't make my code working.
As usual, in those type of situations you fire up your debugger in order to understand what is going on under the hood.
That was a bit weird, to give you a bit of context I was doing some inline x86 assembly, and I've put on purpose an <em>int3</em> just
before the piece of assembly code I thought was buggy. Once my file loaded in <a href="http://ollydbg.de/version2.html">OllyDbg2</a>, I hit <em>F9</em> in order to reach quickly the <em>int3</em> I've slipped into the inline assembly code. A bit of single-stepping, and <strong>BOOM</strong> I got a nasty crash. It happens sometimes, and that's uncool.
Then, I relaunch my binary and try to reproduce the bug: same actions and <strong>BOOM</strong> again. OK, this time it's cool, I got a reproducible crash in OllyDbg2.</p>
<p>I like when things like that happens to me (remember the crashes I've found in OllyDbg/IDA here: <a href="http://download.tuxfamily.org/overclokblog/PDB%20ain%27t%20PDD/0vercl0k_pdb_aint_pdd.pdf">PDB Ain't PDD</a>), it's always a nice exercise for me where I've to:</p>
<ul>
<li>pinpoint the bug in the application: usually not trivial when it's a real/big application</li>
<li>reverse-engineer the codes involved in the bug in order to figure out why it's happening (sometimes I got the sources, sometimes I don't like this time)</li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, I will show you how I've manage to pinpoint where the bug was, using <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff549561(v=vs.85).aspx">GFlags, PageHeap</a> and <a href="http://www.windbg.info/">WinDbg</a>. Then, we will reverse-engineer the buggy code in order to understand why the bug is happening, and how we can code a clean trigger.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when you are reverse-engineering binaries you need somehow to measure, or just to have an idea about how much "that" execution is covering the code of your target. It can be for fuzzing purpose, maybe you have a huge set of inputs (it can be files, network traffic, anything) and you want to have the same coverage with only a subset of them. Or maybe, you are not really interested in the measure, but only with the coverage differences between two executions of your target: to locate where your program is handling a specific feature for example.</p>
<p>But it's not a trivial problem, usually you don't have the source-code of the target, and you want it to be quick. The other thing, is that you don't have an input that covers the whole code base, you don't even know if it's possible ; so you can't compare your analysis to that "ideal one". Long story short, you can't say to the user "OK, this input covers 10% of your binary". But you can clearly register what your program is doing with input A, what it is doing with input B and then analyzing the differences. With that way you can have a (more precise?) idea about which input seems to have better coverage than another.</p>
<p>Note also, this is a perfect occasion to play with Pin :-)).</p>
<p>In this post, I will explain briefly how you can build that kind of tool using Pin, and how it can be used for reverse-engineer purposes.</p>
